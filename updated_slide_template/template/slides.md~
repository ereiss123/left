# Making slides

* I like [Slidy] html presentations, but many prefer \LaTeX/Beamer presentations
in PDF format. So this template is designed to:

   - Produce html output based on slidy
   - Produce matching PDF output based on \LaTeX/Beamer


# Methods

* Slides are written using [Markdown]() and compiled with [Pandoc]().
* Procedure
   1. Prepare slides in a text document using Markdown syntax.
   2. Place aby images in the `figures/` subdirectory.
   3. Edit the included `Makefile` to provide the presentation name and other details.
   4. Build the presentation by running `make`
